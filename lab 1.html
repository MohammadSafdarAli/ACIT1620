    <h1>The power of Technology in real life</h1>

    <p>Every single day has been a day where humans have been using technology, from the phones we communicate with to those big bitcoin miner computers that companies use to generate revenue. Humans have advanced in civilization ever since the creation of modern day technology. However we should be focusing on ethical standpoints in the technology fields like focusing more on privacy of the user and not corporate greed.  </p>
